--  Supplies constants for standardized HTTP methods while the parent Method
--  type remains open to extension tokens. A constant identifies wire spelling
--  and semantics; an individual protocol engine may still reject a method it
--  cannot complete safely. In particular, the initial Client has no tunnel
--  handoff API and therefore rejects CONNECT.
