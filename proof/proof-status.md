# Proof Status: Fable 5 prevention coverage
<!-- Reflect the top-level goal given. Items in the list below are moved from
     Not Started to In Progress to Reviewed and finally to Proved and Finalized. -->

Findings #5, #8, #10, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, and #47 are
prevented by production-consumed SPARK units. Their assigned targeted
subprogram proofs and fresh whole-unit widenings passed at level 1.
Finding #8 proves the scalar dequeue transition consumed by both bounded-channel
receive paths: its vacated position is the old head, while its next head and
count are the corresponding ring advance and decrement. The generic channel
body, its use of the returned position, arbitrary element resource semantics,
and controlled assignment/finalization remain outside SPARK. Capacity-two wrap,
controlled-retention, and exceptional-ordering tests cover that boundary in
both task lanes.
Finding #10 proves only that the Ada listener descriptor token is consumed
after the imported close function returns. It does not model `close(2)`, its
return semantics, or descriptor reuse; focused fault-enabled coverage exercises
that boundary in both task lanes.
The finding #6 fix consumes the pre-existing proved
`Flyology.Time_Math.To_Nanoseconds`; this follow-up required no new policy unit.
The chunk encoder proof includes complete hexadecimal-digit consumption through
`Natural'Last`, so the historical seven-digit capacity cannot prove.
Finding #13 proves the negotiated encoder-window bound. Finding #18 proves only
exact distance-tree classification and missing-distance enforcement; it
excludes reserved-symbol rejection and does not claim general DEFLATE
correctness.
The WebSocket timeout classifier treats failed-or-terminal state as an input
and does not prove that the I/O core sets that state, so behavioral integration
coverage remains required.
Finding #12 uses the production connection's persistent frame cursor. Its
proved transitions preserve payload phase, frame identity, remaining bytes,
absolute mask position, and the separate completion and abandonment reset
boundaries. Focused behavioral coverage exercises the surrounding I/O paths;
protocol I/O itself remains outside SPARK.
Finding #47 proves that the classifier consumed by `Decode_Path` rejects
exactly slash-delimited `.` and `..` segments in its decoded string input. It
does not prove percent decoding, request-target extraction and query removal,
UTF-8 validation, or HTTP error mapping; focused routing integration coverage
exercises those surrounding behaviors.
Finding #1 has partial prevention coverage. Its targeted proofs and fresh
whole-unit widening passed at level 1 and mode all, establishing only bounded
batch budgets and the deterministic Ada file-drain latch and state transitions
consumed by Linux `Wait_Batch`. They do not prove kernel readiness or liveness,
eventfd, epoll, io_uring, the C bridge, CQE existence or delivery, or buffer
ownership; Linux integration and stress coverage remain authoritative for
those behaviors. The widening continued with partial representation data after
the non-code-generating root package spec `s-flyolo.ads` produced no
representation information; the poller-policy unit itself was analyzed with no
warning, assumption, justified check, or unproved check.
The production-used bounded timer-set policy proves indexed-heap validity,
exact arm/cancel/clear transitions, root-minimum selection, and complete unique
extraction of every id armed and due at the supplied monotonic-clock sample.
Task suspension and clock sampling remain outside SPARK and require behavioral
lane-parity coverage.
The HTTP client upload-policy review adds a production-consumed SPARK boundary
for request/source compatibility, exact known-length pull completion,
informational-response accounting, stale-connection replay eligibility, and
the one-attempt `417 Expectation Failed` fallback. It does not prove request or
response I/O, response-head extraction, source callback behavior, rewind byte
identity, trailer-field definition rules, or the connection-lifecycle actions
selected by those classifications. Exhaustive policy matrices and focused
wire, adapter, ownership, and retry tests cover that integration boundary.
